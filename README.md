A map of connected rooms. Four hunters, each with a single device to take readings of evidence from a room. A ghost, wandering around and leaving evidence for hunters to find. When a hunter is in a room with a ghost, their fear level goes from 0 to 100, and when they reach 100, they’re out of there!
