# Final-Project-Systems-Programming
A map of connected rooms. Four hunters, each with a single device to take readings of evidence from a room. A ghost, wandering around and leaving evidence for hunters to find. When a hunter is in a room with a ghost, their fear level goes from 0 to 15, and when they reach 15, they’re out of there!
